#
# Extending a class definition
#
# The program below defines a class of objects called Walkers, which
# pace around the screen in a square pattern.  It creates one
# such object and makes it take a fixed number of steps.
#
# This program is rather boring!  Your job is to make it more
# interesting by extending the class definition and its application
# in a number of ways.  Things you may consider doing include
# the following.
#
# * Extend the main program so that it creates multiple concurrent
#   walkers.
#
# * Add a method to the Walker class which allows the object's colour
#   to be changed, and extend the main program so the walkers change
#   colour periodically.
#
# * Create a subclass called Expanding_Walker whose objects get
#   bigger as they walk.  This could be done either by overriding
#   the "step" method or by adding a separate "grow" function.
#   The size of a turtle object can be changed with the "turtlesize"
#   method which accepts two integers, specifying the horizontal
#   and vertical sizes.
#
