# Here we define a class for "debit card" objects, which have the
# same capabilities as a "bank account" object, but also provide the
# ability to print a statement listing all transactions since the
# previous statement was produced

# Import the superclass
from F_bank_account import *

# A (sub)class for debit card accounts
class Debit_Card_Account(Bank_Account):

    # When a debit card account object is created, initialise the
    # owner's name, opening balance and the statement
    def __init__(self, depositor, opening_deposit):
        # Initialise the basic account
        Bank_Account.__init__(self, depositor, opening_deposit)
        # Initialise the transaction statement
        self.__statement = []

    # Override the bank account's deposit method to record
    # the transaction (as a nicely-formatted string)

        Bank_Account.deposit(self, amount)
        self.__statement = self.__statement + ['+$%.2f' % amount]

    # the statement, provided the withdrawal will succeed

            self.__statement = self.__statement + ['-$%.2f' % amount]
        Bank_Account.withdraw(self, amount)

    # Produce the printable form of a debit card account object
    # as a statement of transactions since the last
    # statement was printed, plus the balance
    def __str__(self):
        # Initialise statement with a heading
        this_statement = 'Recent transactions:\n'
