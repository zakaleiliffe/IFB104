A Joke

One spring morning - so the story goes - two village tradesmen
met on the road to work.  Said one, noticing that his mate's
jack plane was slung with the axe-handle through its mouth,
"Where's the job, Bill?"  To which Bill, with ponderous mirth,
replied, "Up at her Ladyship's.  She's broke her jewel-case."

From "The Australian Home Handyman", ca. 1935
