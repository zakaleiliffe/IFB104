##  Demonstration - An expression evaluator with history
##
##  This demonstration illustrates development of an
##  interactive program which is made robust to
##  user-input errors through exception handling.
##


#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Requirements specification
#
# The IDLE interpreter's interactive shell window keeps a history
# which allows the last value returned to be referenced via the
# special variable '_'.
#
# The aim here is to develop a generalisation of this concept
# as an expression evaluation environment that keeps
# a history of all returned values and allows the nth value returned
# to be displayed by entering 'Recall n'.  The user can stop the
# program by typing 'Quit'.
# 


#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Fragile version
#
# This version of the expression evaluator works perfectly as
# long as the user never makes an error, but will crash if
# given an unexpected input value.
#
# Try it with the following inputs in the order shown:
#
# 1 + 5
# 'bb' + 'ccc'
# 4 * 'd'
# recall 1
# 34 + 89
# recall 2
# recall 0
# 4 ** 4
# a * n      <- This input will cause a crash
# 'a' + 45   <- So will this one
# recall 8   <- And so will this one
# Control-C  <- And this will stop the program inelegantly
#
def fragile_history():
    
    history = []
    while True:
        user_expression = raw_input('[' + str(len(history)) + '] >>> ')
        if user_expression.lower() == 'quit':
            # User wants to stop
            print 'Goodbye'
            break
        elif user_expression.lower().startswith('recall '):
            # User wants to see the value of a previous expression
            print history[eval(user_expression[7:])]
        else:
            # Evaluate the user's expression
            history = history + [eval(user_expression)]
            print history[-1]


#---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Robust version
#
# This version of the expression evaluator can never crash because
# it catches all exceptions.  For certain anticipated kinds of input
# error it displays a meaningful error message.
