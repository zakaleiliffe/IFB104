# Show title
#
# A well-structured HTML/XML file will have a "TITLE" markup
# which contains the heading to be displayed in the Web
# browser's window or tab.  Given a URL, this program attempts
# to download the corresponding Web document, extract its
# title, and print it.  However, the program will crash if
# given an invalid address.  Uncommenting the exception
# handling code below, and indenting the original code,
# will make the program immune to this failure.
#
# Some URLs to try are as follows.  The first two will
# work correctly but the last two won't!
