# Dividing Fractions
#
# THE CHALLENGE
#
# According to one of the laws of arithmetic, the following
# two expressions are always equal, for any numbers a, b,
# c and d:
#
# 1)  (a / b) / (c / d)
#
# 2)  (a * d) / (b * c)
#
# Although this is a mathematical fact, it may not always
# hold for specific examples of *computer* arithmetic, due to
# rounding errors and the different ways integers and floating
# point numbers are processed.
#
# a) Write Python expressions that confirm this mathematical
# equivalence holds for particular values of a, b, c and d.
#
# b) Find an example of values for a, b, c and d for which the
# equivalence is NOT true in Python.  (And see if you can
# figure out why.)
