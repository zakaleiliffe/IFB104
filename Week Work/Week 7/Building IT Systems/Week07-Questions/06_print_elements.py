#
# Print a table of the elements
#
# In this exercise you will develop a Python program that
# accesses a MySQL database.  We assume that you have
# already loaded a version of the Elements database using
# the a graphical user interface.  You can do so by importing
# the elements_v2.sql script provided.  (This database is
# slightly different than the one used in last week's
# workshop.  You may see some dubious looking data in this
# database!  If this worries you, do the "Delete elements"
# exercise!)
#
# Your tasks:
#
# 1) Browse the database's contents in an interactive interface
# to ensure that you're familiar with its two tables and
# their columns.
#
# 2) In your interactive interface, develop a SELECT query which
# prints all available details of the elements in the database.
# The result set should be ordered by atomic number as follows:
#
#   atomic_number   element_name   symbol
#   1               Hydrogen       H
#   2               Helium         He
#   3               Lithium        Li
#   4               Beryllium      Be
#   5               Boron          B
#   6               Carbon         C
#   7               Nitrogen       N
#   8               Oxygen         O
#   9               Fluorine       F
#   10              Neon           Ne
#   11              Sodium         Na
#   12              Magnesium      Mg
#   13              Aluminium      Al
#   14              Silicon        Si
#   15              Phosphorous    P
#   16              Sulphur        S
#   17              Chlorine       Cl
#   18              Argon          Ar
#   19              Potassium      K
#   20              Calcium        Ca
#   21              Kryptonite     Kr
#   22              Dalekanium     Dk
# 
# 3) Using this SELECT query, write a Python program to print
# all the element details in the database.  Recall that after an
# SQL query has been executed on a database "cursor", method call
# "cursor.fetchall()" will return a list of all rows in the
# result set, and you can then use a FOR-EACH loop to process each
# row in the list.

#---------------------------------------------------------

# Get the MySQL-Python functions:
from mysql.connector import *

# Alternative connector:
# from MySQLdb import *

## DEVELOP YOUR PROGRAM HERE BY REPLACING EACH OF THE 'pass'
## STATEMENTS BELOW (WHICH DO NOTHING) WITH THE NECESSARY CODE

# Connect to the elements database and print the atomic
# number, name and symbol for each element.

# 1. Make a connection to the elements database
pass

# 2. Get a cursor on the database
pass

# 3. Construct the SQL query
pass

# 4. Execute the query
pass

# 5. Get the result set and print it out
pass

# 6. Close the cursor and connection
pass
