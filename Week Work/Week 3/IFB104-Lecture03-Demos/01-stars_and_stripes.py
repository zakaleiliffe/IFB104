# Star and stripes - Demo of functions and modules
#
# To demonstrate how functions can be used to structure code
# and avoid duplication, this program draws the United States
# flag.  The U.S. flag has many duplicated elements -
# the repeated stripes and stars - and would be very
# tedious to draw if we had to do each part separately.
#
# Instead we import a function to draw a single stripe and
# another function to draw a single star, and repeatedly
# "call" these functions to create multiple stars and stripes.


# Import the graphics functions required
from turtle import *

# Import the functions that draw the stars and stripes
from flag_elements import star, stripe


#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define some global constants that determine the flag's
# proportions
